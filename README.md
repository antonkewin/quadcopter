# quadcopter
Started a project on balancing quadcopter using arduino, mpu6050, hmc5883l.
Obtained pitch and roll angles from MPU6050. The arduino code has been attached with this repository.
Validation of the pitch and roll angles also has been verified using a 3d model, which is constructed using Processing Software.
Processing code also has been attached to the repository.
